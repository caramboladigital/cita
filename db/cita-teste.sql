(69, 18, '182', 'The emperor founded, under the name of Aelia Capitolina, a new city on Mount Sion, to which he gave the privileges of a colony; and denouncing the severest penalties against any of the Jewish people who should dare to approach its precincts, he fixed a vigilant garrison of a Roman cohort to enforce the execution of his orders.  The Nazarenes had only one way left to escape the common proscription, and the force of truth was on this occasion assisted by the influence of temporal advantages.  They elected Marcus for their bishop, a prelate of the race of the Gentiles, and most probably a native either of Italy or of some of the Latin provinces.  At his persuasion, the most considerable part of the congregation renounced the Mosaic law, in the practice of which they had persevered above a century.  By this sacrifice of their habits and prejudices, they purchased a free admission into the colony of Hadrian, and more firmly cemented their union with the Catholic church.', NULL),
(70, 18, '184', 'The Christians, who, by the interposition of evil spirits, could so readily explain every preternatural appearance, were disposed and even desirous to admit the most extravagant fictions of the Pagan mythology.  But the belief of the Christian was accompanied with horror. The most trifling mark of respect to the national worship he considered as a direct homage yielded to the daemon, and as an act of rebellion against the majesty of God. In consequence of this opinion, it was the first but arduous duty of a Christian to preserve himself pure and undefiled by the practice of idolatry.', NULL),

From these specious and noble principles, the philosophers who trod in the footsteps of Plato deduced a very unjustifiable conclusion, since they asserted, not only the future immortality, but the past eternity, of the human soul, which they were too apt to consider as a portion of the infinite and self-existing spirit, which pervades and sustains the universe.', NULL),

(78, 18, '458', 'The fifteen priests, who composed the college of pontiffs, enjoyed a more distinguished rank as the companions of their sovereign; and the Christian emperors condescended to accept the robe and ensigns, which were appropriated to the office of supreme pontiff.  But when Gratian ascended the throne, more scrupulous or more enlightened, he sternly rejected those profane symbols; applied to the service of the state, or of the church, the revenues of the priests and vestals; abolished their honors and immunities; and dissolved the ancient fabric of Roman superstition, which was supported by the opinions and habits of eleven hundred years.', NULL),

The liberty of suffrages, which he affected to allow, was destroyed by the hopes and fears that his presence inspired; and the arbitrary exile of Symmachus was a recent admonition, that it might be dangerous to oppose the wishes of the monarch.

Many of those temples were the most splendid and beautiful monuments of Grecian architecture; and the emperor himself was interested not to deface the splendor of his own cities, or to diminish the value of his own possessions.  Those stately edifices might be suffered to remain, as so many lasting trophies of the victory of Christ.  In the decline of the arts they might be usefully converted into magazines, manufactures, or places of public assembly: and perhaps, when the walls of the temple had been sufficiently purified by holy rites, the worship of the true Deity might be allowed to expiate the ancient guilt of idolatry.', NULL),

As the temples had been erected for the purpose of sacrifice, it was the duty of a benevolent prince to remove from his subjects the dangerous temptation of offending against the laws which he had enacted.  A special commission was granted to Cynegius, the Praetorian praefect of the East, and afterwards to the counts Jovius and Gaudentius, two officers of distinguished rank in the West; by which they were directed to shut the temples, to seize or destroy the instruments of idolatry, to abolish the privileges of the priests, and to confiscate the consecrated property for the benefit of the emperor, of the church, or of the army.', NULL),

The rites of Pagan superstition, which might seem less bloody and atrocious, are abolished, as highly injurious to the truth and honor of religion; luminaries, garlands, frankincense, and libations of wine, are specially enumerated and condemned; and the harmless claims of the domestic genius, of the household gods, are included in this rigorous proscription.', NULL),
(87, 19, '195', 'Under the successors of Constantine, in the peace and luxury of the triumphant church, the more prudent bishops condescended to indulge a visible superstition, for the benefit of the multitude; and, after the ruin of Paganism, they were no longer restrained by the apprehension of an odious parallel.

At first, the experiment was made with caution and scruple; and the venerable pictures were discreetly allowed to instruct the ignorant, to awaken the cold, and to gratify the prejudices of the heathen proselytes.  By a slow though inevitable progression, the honors of the original were transferred to the copy: the devout Christian prayed before the image of a saint; and the Pagan rites of genuflection, luminaries, and incense, again stole into the Catholic church.', NULL),
(89, 19, '195', 'The primitive Christians were possessed with an unconquerable repugnance to the use and abuse of images; and this aversion may be ascribed to their descent from the Jews, and their enmity to the Greeks.

(94, 19, '196', 'The merit and effect of a copy depends on its resemblance with the original; but the primitive Christians were ignorant of the genuine features of the Son of God, his mother, and his apostles: the statue of Christ at Paneas in Palestine  was more probably that of some temporal savior; the Gnostics and their profane monuments were reprobated; and the fancy of the Christian artists could only be guided by the clandestine imitation of some heathen model.', NULL),
(95, 19, '197', 'The worship of images had stolen into the church by insensible degrees, and each petty step was pleasing to the superstitious mind, as productive of comfort, and innocent of sin.  But in the beginning of the eighth century, in the full magnitude of the abuse, the more timorous Greeks were awakened by an apprehension, that under the mask of Christianity, they had restored the religion of their fathers: they heard, with grief and impatience, the name of idolaters; the incessant charge of the Jews and Mahometans, who derived from the Law and the Koran an immortal hatred to graven images and all relative worship.', NULL),

There is not much evidence that they have been used with success, even by their inventors, and there is reason to believe that newcomers to design methodology often revert to more familiar, if less adequate, producers when difficulties are encountered. The usual difficulty is that of losing control of the design situation once one is committed to a systematic procedure which seems to fit the problema less and less as designing protocols.<br>(...)<br>Perhaps we can identify the strengths as well as the weaknesses of traditional methods by posing and answering four critical questions:<br><br>1.

A complex system is not constituted merely by the sum of its components, but also by the intricate relationships between these components. In \'cutting up\' a system, the analytical method destroys what it seeks to understand. Fortunately this does not mean that the investigation of complexity is hopeless.

Since these narratives are all local, they cannot be linked together to form a grand narrative which unifies all knowledge. The postmodern condition is characterised by the co-existence of a multiplicity of heterogeneous discourses - a state of affairs assessed differently by different parties. Those who have a nostalgia for a unifying metanarrative - a dream central to the History of Western metaphysics - experience the postmodernism condition as fragmented, full of anarchy and therefore ultimately meaningless.

(365, 63, '28', 'We have seen that one purpose of a scale drawing, the main instrument of the traditional designer, is to give him a much greater \'perceptual span\' than was available to the craftsman. It gives him the freedom to alter the shape of the product as a whole, instead of being tied, as the craftsman is, to making only minor changes. Thus the scale drawing can be seen as a rapidly manipulable model of the relationship between the components of which the product is composed. The speed with which this model can be perceived and changed, and its capacity to store tentative decisions con-cerning one part while another part is being attended to, enable the designer to deal with an otherwise unmanageable, and unimaginable, degree of complexity. If, for instance, a designer is considering a product composed of ten parts and there are ten alternative ways in which each can be designed, the total number of potential product designs that he has to choose between is ten thousand million (10^10). If he uses a drawing to select a set of ten parts that are geometrically compatible with each other, his task is reduced to choosing ten times between ten sub-solutions. The total number of choices to be made falls from ten thousand million to a hundred. If he subsequently explores nine more designs (i.e. sets of geo-metrically compatible parts) he has still only dealt with a thousand possibi-lities. Thus we can see how a scale drawing greatly shortens the time needed to pick out an acceptable design from a huge number of alterna-tives. It does this by enabling the designer to disregard nearly all of the search space and to concentrate his attention on small parts of it in which acceptable designs are to be expected. <br>When considering the external, as opposed to the internal, compatibility of a new product the designer gets no help from the drawing and has to rely, in the main, upon his experience and his imagination and, to a lesser extent, upon the calculation and testing of what are thought to be critical aspects of performance.', 'Rui: ao mesmo tempo é preciso notar que o \'design by drawing\' não cobre todo o solution landscape.

To be more practical, there are many versions of solution generated during the course of design, where each current one is, in general, an improvement over the previous one . This kind of synthesis of solutions can be viewed as an evolutionary system over time.<br>The view of design as state-space search has dominated the research direction of the AI-in-Design community for some time.

It seems that creative design is not a matter of first fixing the problem (through objective analysis or the imposition of a frame) and then searching for a satisfactory solution concept.  Creative design seems more to be a matter of developing and refining together both the formulation of a problem and ideas for a solution, with constant iteration of analysis, synthesis and evaluation processes between the two notional design ‘spaces’ - problem space and solution space.  In creative design, the designer is seeking to generate a matching problem-solution pair, through a ‘co-evolution’ of the problem and the solution.

This kink, or \'waist\', as it is called, is the wagon maker\'s attempt to reduce the turning circle by allowing the front axle to rotate a little farther before the front wheels strike the side of the wagon. The discordant appearance of this kink suggests that the process of craft evolution had not yet assimilated the sudden changes of demand that occurred in late eighteenth century England when traditional two-wheeled farm carts were replaced by novel forms of four-wheeled wagons. We can see here the weakness of changing only one-thing-at-a-time, and of relying on precedent, when what seems to be called for is a complete reorganization of the form as a whole. <br>4. The cumulative store of the essential information generated by craft evolution is, firstly, the form of the product itself, which is not changed except to correct errors or to meet new demands. Fragmentary information is stored as patterns (cross-section profiles and the like) and also as exact memories, learnt during apprenticeship, of the actions needed to re-create the traditional shape of the product. These information stores could be said to provide the \'genetic coding\' upon which craft evolution depends. <br>5. The two classes of data that are most important in designing today, the shape of the product as a whole and the reasons for the shape, are not recorded in a symbolic medium and therefore cannot be investigated and altered without makeshift experiments with the product itself. Such experiments involve the loss of the patiently-won balance and fit of an earlier design and are attempted only when new demands cannot be met by gradual evolution.', '- novamente, como no trecho anterior, não há gene (informação codificada) mas há o meme, isto é o objeto em si.

(397, 63, '20', 'The method of designing by making scale drawings will be familiar to many readers of this book. The essential difference between this, the normal method of evolving the shapes of machine-made things, and the earlier method of craft evolution, is that trial-and-error is separated from production by using a scale drawing in place of the product as the medium for experiment and change. This separation of thinking front making has several important effects: <br><br>1. Specifying dimensions in advance of manufacture makes it possible to split up the productions work into separate pieces which can be made by different people. This is the \'division of labour\' which is both the strength and the weakness of industrial society. <br><br>2. Initially this advantage of drawing-before-making made possible the planning of things that were too big for a single craftsman to make on his own, e.g. large ships and buildings. Only when critical dimensions have been fixed in advance can the works of many craftsmen be made to fit together. (Normally a craftsman makes a series of minor variations and counter-variations in a continuous process of adjusting one part to another with the result that no two of his products are exactly alike.) It is of course possible for a number of craftsmen to collaborate in the making of a large object, such as a farm wagon, without the prior existence of a scale drawing. In such cases the points of contact beiweeen one man\'s work and another\'s are specifial by standard dimensions. or by full-size patterns, to which each man works.', 'Rui: o fato de se desenhar antes de construir também aumenta não só a capacidade de projetar \"coisas muito grandes\" mas também permite incluir um diálogo entre projetista e produto que admite um outro tipo de reflexão analítica.

(398, 63, '29', 'There are, however, three points about which nearly all writers agree and these are very relevant to our inquiry:<br><br>1. There are often long periods when the person who is about to make an original work appears to do nothing but take in information, work rather fruitlessly at seemingly trivial aspects of the problem, or give his attention to unrelated matters. This is called \'incubation\'.<br>2. The solution to a difficult problem, or the occurrence of an original idea, will often come all of a sudden (the \'leap of insight\') and will take the form of a dramatic change in the way in which the problem is perceived (a change of \'set\'). The effect of this transformation is often to turn a complicated problem into a simple one.<br>3. The enemies of originality are mental rigidity and wishful thinking. These are evident when a person acts either in a far more regular way than the situation demands or else is incapable of perceiving the external realities that make his ideas unfeasible.', NULL),

(...) <br>Many will resist this view because it places too much responsibility upon designers and too little upon everyone else.

Without something equivalent to a drawing (in which to store, and to manipulate, the relationships between products) the systems designer is not free to concentrate upon one bit of the problem at a time and he has no medium in which he could conceive of a tentative solution which would enable him to drastically shorten his search. To tick ti the traditional use of drawings of products as the stable elements in a creative search process is, of course, to utterly inhibit innovation at the systems level.<br><br>2. Without some systems equivalent of the well-informed and uninhibited brain-and-pencil of a skilled designer there is no means of making the very rapid judgements of the feasibility of critical details that makes possible the leap of insight that turns and over-complicated problem into one that is simple enough to solve by attending to the sub-problems in sequence rather that simultaneously. Unfortunately the information necessary to assess feasibility of a new system proposal is scattered among many brains and many publications and some of it may have to be discovered by new research.<br><br>3. Many of the people who carry in their experience the pieces of information upon which the designing of a new system depends, have vested interests in rejecting anything but small departures from the status quo and are likely to make biased judgements upon the long term merits or demerits of major changes.<br><br>4. The selection of simplifying proposals that are sufficiently precise to permit detailed exploration of feasibility involves the exercise of value judgements that, at the systems level, are vital to community interests.

A new problem is like an unknown land, of unknown extent,  in which the explorer searches by making a network of journeys. This network is not something that exists before the begins, he has to invent it, either before he starts or as he proceeds. Design methods are like the navigational tools and charts that he uses to plot the course of the journey so as to maintain some control over where he goes. Unless he is very unlucky, or very stupid, he will come across the treasure long before he has searched every inch of the ground. His main objective, in mapping the track of his search is to make as much sense as he can of every fragmentary clue that he can find so that he can arrived at the treasure without spending a lifetime on the search. Designing, like navigation, would be a straightforward matter if one did not have to depend upon inadequate information in the first place. The point at which this analogy breaks down is in the nature of the space to be searched, The designer\'s landscape, unlike that of the explorer, is an unstable and imaginary one: it changes its form according to the assumptions that the individual is obliged to make and according to the willingness of others to put his plans into effect.', NULL),
(406, 63, '55', 'The main weakness of both of these approaches (black box and glass box) is that the designer generates a universe of unfamiliar alternatives that is too large to be explored by the slow process of conscious thought.

Every time a new solution was sent in, it was quickly scored, ranked, and posted to the website. Every other contestant could then see the programming code, in full. They could cut and paste the best bits and resubmit it with any improvements, however minor.

Those roles depend on RNA shapes, the way the shape of a key determines which lock it can open. And that’s where things get tricky. RNA shapes depend on how the molecules’ components fit together, but the rules that govern what fits where are not well understood. Shapes that should work in theory often prove impossible to produce in practice.<br><br>The game EteRNA, which was started by the Stanford biochemist Rhiju Das and the Carnegie Mellon computer scientist Adrien Treuille, allows researchers to farm out some of the intellectual legwork behind RNA design to 26,000 players, rather than a relatively few lab workers. Players are given a puzzle design—an RNA molecule in the shape of a star or a cross, for example—that they must fill in with the components, called nucleotides, to produce the most plausible solution.<br><br>The community of players then votes for the blueprint it thinks will have the best chance of success in the lab. The Stanford researchers select the highest-rated blueprints and actually synthesize them. The scientists then report back the results of the experiments to the crowd to inform future designs.<br><br>The crowd-sourcing has produced results that tend to be more effective than computer-generated arrangements. “Computational methods are not perfect in making these shapes,” says Mr. Das, “and as we get to more and more complex ones, they essentially always fail, so we know that there are rules to be learned.”<br><br>Players are figuring out these principles on their own, says Mr. Treuille. He says that while they’re more like a grandmother’s instructions on baking a cake than a strict scientific formula, they work remarkably well in practice. “EteRNA players are extremely good at designing RNA’s,” says Mr. Treuille, “which is all the more surprising because the top algorithms published by scientists are not nearly so good. The gap is pretty dramatic.”<br><br>He attributes this chasm to the fact that humans are much better than machines at thinking through the scientific process and making intelligent decisions based on past results. “A computer is completely flummoxed by not knowing the rules, but players are unfazed: they look at the data, they make their designs, and they do phenomenally.”<br><br>Since the game-and-crowdsourcing project began in January, Mr. Das’s lab has synthesized 306 designs in test tubes, and he hopes to soon begin testing these molecules in cells.

They raced the boats they already had for normal purposes, boats that were designed for fishing, or transporting goods, or sailing around on weekends. It was quickly observed that races are more interesting if the competitors are roughly equal in speed and maneuverability. So rules evolved, that defined various classes of boat by length and sail area and other parameters, and that restricted races to competitors of the same class. Soon boats were being designed not for normal sailing but for winning races within the categories defined by the rules. They squeezed the last possible burst of speed out of a square inch of sail, or the lightest possible load out of a standard-sized rudder. These boats were strange looking and strange handling, not at all the sort of boat you would want to take out fishing or for a Sunday sail. As the races became more serious, the rules became stricter and the boat designs more bizarre. Now, racing sailboats are extremely fast, highly responsive, and nearly unseaworthy.
